## Instructions
1. How to Run the game

Visit https://github.com/shahlime/Udacity-Arcade-Game, clone this repository to your computer and open `index.html` in your browser, I recommend chrome!

2. How to Play

Game begins immediately when page is opened, at first 2 bugs appear at a steady pace.

Cross the road and reach the water to win a point, keep in mind the difficulty will go up, every 2 points!

Use keypads left, right, up, down to move your Player and try to get to the river without touching any bugs.

Once you reach the water, your Player will respawn back into original position, you gain one point! If you collide with the bugs, Player will again reset but so will your points!
